# mrmapping
It is a HashMap-Relation mapping library that converts the table of database to Java HashMap. It provides both short connection and long connection method to database, including select, update, batch insert and delete methods. You can also build dynamic “select where” and “update set” sql clauses by using “getSetStatement” and “getWhereStatement” methods. Liking spring or ibatis, you can embed your sql into database transactions. 

If you want to get full detail of how to use this library, please read MRMappingTest.java.
